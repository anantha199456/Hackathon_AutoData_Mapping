**Description:**
• Use of Python to create a Data Mapping where the source will be of any file type, even though schemas are different (Column name, order may change between files).
• Python module should have capability of understanding the nature of data and do a column map between File and Table (Fixed Structure). Column map with threshold limit as a variable.
• We will also report the difference if it exceeds threshold limit through email as a report.
• We used File types such as Excel, CSV, JSON, XML.
